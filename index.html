  <section class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h2>Sharepoint 2010</h2><p><strong>Development Changes.</strong><br> SharePoint 2010 Introduced Sandbox solutions to help developers deploy code that did not effect the whole farm. In SharePoint 2010 you could use Server Object model and Client Object model (.Net Managed, ECMASCRIPT and silverlight) to extract data from SharePoint. In SharePoint 2010 developers were also developing Farm solutions as they did with the previous SharePoint 2007 version.</p></section>
  <section class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h2>Sharepoint 2013</h2><p><strong>Development Changes.</strong><br> In SharePoint 2013 Microsoft Introduced a new Cloud App Model for designing Apps for SharePoint. Apps for SharePoint are self-contained pieces of functionality that extend the capabilities of a SharePoint website. You can use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and protocols like the Open Data protocol (OData), and OAuth to communicate with SharePoint using Apps. Tools – SharePoint 2013 has Introduced new Tools for App development. Visual Studio 2012 now lets you develop apps for SharePoint and apps for Office. In addition a new web-based tools called “Napa” Office 365 Development Tools were introduced for developing apps. No more Sandbox solutions. SharePoint 2013 sandboxed solutions are deprecated. So all we got is the New App model and the Old SharePoint Farm solutions. </p></section>
  <section class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h2>Sharepoint 2016</h2><p><strong>Development Changes.</strong><br> New compliance features for SharePoint Server 2016 include the document deletion and in-place hold policies. The compile time for customized XSLT files used for Content Query, Summary Links, and Table of Contents Web Parts is improved. SharePoint Server 2016 includes new document library accessibility features. Resource-based URLs now retain links when documents are renamed or moved in SharePoint. SharePoint Server 2016 now supports using some special characters in file names that were blocked in previous versions.</p></section>
